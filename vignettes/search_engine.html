<span class="co">#&gt; OPEC may be forced to meet before a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the problems,&quot; said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Research Associates, CERA.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; issue and must be addressed in that way,&quot; said Paul Mlotok, oil</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; ability to keep production under control have given way to a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials,&quot; said the</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; on condition that he not be named. &quot;The market is now trying to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; teach them that lesson again,&quot; he added.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; when demand slackens,&quot; Mizrahi said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; since buyers will come back into the market then,&quot; said Dillard</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; has been rising through the first quarter and this may have</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; prompted excesses in its production.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; demand through current production,&quot; he told Reuters in a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; telephone interview.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;  Reuter</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;  </span>
<span class="co">#&gt; </span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Kuwait&quot;s Oil Minister, in remarks</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; oil prices.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; daily al-Qabas as saying: &quot;None of the OPEC members has asked</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; for such a meeting.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; limits of the 13-nation organisation.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; bpd agreed in Geneva last December.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so,&quot; the minister</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;If we can sell more than our quota at official prices,</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever,&quot; he said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar,</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; of 18 dlrs per barrel.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 19 dollars a barrel.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Ali also delivered &quot;a challenge to any international</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; of its local and international refining facilities and its own</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; distribution network abroad, he added.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC&quot;s</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; differentials committee has been postponed until the start of</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; April at the request of certain of the body&quot;s members.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Ecuador&quot;s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; talks this month of opec&quot;s pricing committee.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: &quot;We</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; expected such pressure. It will continue through March and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; April.&quot; But he expected the situation would later improve.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; Indonesia appears to be nearing a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; launched a series of measures over the past nine months to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; investment.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year&quot;s</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; currency by 31 pct in September.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto&quot;s</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; government appears to be divided over what direction to lead</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the economy.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports,&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia&quot;s agricultural</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; sector, but also reviews the country&quot;s general economic</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; performance.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     It says that while many government officials and advisers</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; are recommending further relaxation, &quot;there are equally strong</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; pressures being exerted to halt all such moves.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;This group strongly favours an import substitution economy,&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the report says.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Indonesia&quot;s economic changes have been welcomed by the World</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction,</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May,</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; restrictions and liberalised imports.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The report says Indonesia&quot;s economic growth in calendar 1986</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; was probably about zero, and the economy may even have</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; contracted a bit. &quot;This is the lowest rate of growth since the</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; mid-1960s,&quot; the report notes.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; population of 168 million, is facing general elections in</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; April.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; in the economic outlook. &quot;For 1987 early indications point to a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; earnings from the petroleum industry.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     &quot;Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; growth in agriculture,&quot; the report states.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; crucial for the government to get the international lending its</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; needs.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; of payments support was given partly to help the government</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt;     Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the current decline in oil prices.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; meeting of the 13-member organisation.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices,</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; in the last published budget for 1985/86.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; billion riyals.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; projected revenue of 9.7 billion.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; pct.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He urged heads of government departments and public</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; the country's foreign reserves.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; allocated for major projects including housing and public</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; buildings, social services, health, education, transport and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; communications, electricity and water, industry and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; agriculture.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; barrels per day.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: &quot;Our expectations of positive signs</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota.&quot;</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; Saudi crude oil output last month fell</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; in January, Gulf oil sources said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; customers.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The production figures include neutral zone output but not</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; sales from floating storage, which are generally considered</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; part of a country's output for Opec purposes.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; a barrel.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; entitlements before the month-end.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON&gt;, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB&gt;, Texaco Inc</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; &lt;TX&gt; and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV&gt; -- signed a long-term agreement</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; come this month, when demand for petroleum products</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; and said it would never sell below official prices.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; refineries.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; at around 200,000 bpd each.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; Opec remains within its agreed output</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Energy Minister Subroto said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; oil.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; using up old stock, he said.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied:</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; &quot;Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day).&quot; He did not elaborate.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; present price difficulties.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; and fourth quarters of 1987.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; Opec meeting.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; spot price. &quot;We hope the weak price will be overcome, and</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; predict the price will be better in the third and fourth</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; quarters.&quot;</span>
<span class="co">#&gt;     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; stuck together.</span>
